# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Download your project
You have already created a ZIP file of your entire project (`project_export_20250523_031801.zip`). Download this file to your local computer.

## Step 2: Extract the ZIP file
Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

## Step 3: Create a GitHub repository
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Fill in a repository name (for example, "fidget-key-shop")
4. Add an optional description
5. Choose whether to make the repository public or private
6. Leave the options "Add a README file", "Add .gitignore", and "Choose a license" unchecked
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 4: Upload your code to GitHub
After creating the repository, GitHub will show instructions for pushing code. You can:

### Option 1: Use GitHub Desktop
1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if you don't have it
2. Click on "Open with GitHub Desktop" from the repository page
3. Select the folder where you extracted your project files
4. Add a commit message like "Initial commit"
5. Click "Commit to main"
6. Click "Publish" to upload to GitHub

### Option 2: Use Git from the command line
Run these commands from the folder where you extracted your project:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your GitHub username and the name of your repository.

### Option 3: Upload directly in the GitHub web interface
For smaller projects, you can also drag and drop files directly in the GitHub web interface:

1. Navigate to your newly created repository
2. Click "Add file" > "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop files from your extracted folder
4. Add a commit message
5. Click "Commit changes"
